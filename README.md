MacOS System Setup
The following instructions are for MacOS Ventura. If you have an earlier operating system but have the option to update, we recommend doing so before following the instructions below. If you are not able to update, earlier operating systems may still be compatible with the requirements for the program, but the instructions below may not always match what you see on your machine.

Note: Throughout the environment setup, you will see commands that look like this:

$ whoami
Any time you see a command like this with a $ at the beginning, those commands should be entered in your terminal without the $. So for the example above, you would type whoami in the terminal without a $.
